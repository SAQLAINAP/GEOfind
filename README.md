Description:

The "Geolocation GUI Extension" is a user-friendly Python application leveraging the power of geolocation services to calculate the distance between two locations. Built using the Tkinter library for the graphical user interface and the geopy library for geolocation functionality, this GUI extension simplifies the process of obtaining accurate distance measurements.

## Key Features:

- **Easy-to-Use Interface**: The application provides a straightforward interface with labeled entry fields for the current location and destination, ensuring a user-friendly experience.

- **Geolocation Integration**: Utilizing the Nominatim geocoding service, the application retrieves geolocation information for the entered addresses, allowing precise distance calculations.

- **Real-Time Distance Calculation**: The "Calculate Distance" button triggers the application to fetch geolocation data for the specified locations and calculate the distance between them in real-time.

- **Informative Output**: The calculated distance is presented in kilometers and displayed dynamically in the result label, providing users with immediate feedback.

- **Error Handling**: The application includes error-handling mechanisms to gracefully manage situations where geolocation information cannot be retrieved. Clear error messages guide users to check their input.

## How to Use:

1. **Run the Application**:
   - Execute the script in a Python environment, and the graphical user interface will appear.
   - Enter the current location and destination addresses in the provided entry fields.

2. **Calculate Distance**:
   - Click the "Calculate Distance" button to initiate the geolocation retrieval and distance calculation process.

3. **View Results**:
   - The calculated distance in kilometers will be displayed in the result label.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - In case of an error, such as the inability to retrieve geolocation information, clear error messages will guide you to check and correct your input.

5. **Close the Application**:
   - Close the application window when you're done.

## Dependencies:

- Tkinter: GUI toolkit for building the user interface.
- Geopy: Geocoding library providing access to Nominatim geolocation services.

## How to Run:

```bash
python your_script_name.py
```
